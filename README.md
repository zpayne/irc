Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, we have created a few example applications.

1) Choose the application that you want to run by selecting a language folder

2) Open the file within the folder

3) Follow the run instructions in the file's comments
    
And that's all there is to it! Just have fun. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team

P.S. Oh, one more thing: to start a new project, hop on over to your 
dashboard and hit the big green button labelled "Create New Workspace."

# IRC Project 1

## Partner (or Individual) task

### Piazza & In-Person Guidelines
1. Feel free to discuss how the provided code works.
2. You are not to show to any part of your code --even elided versions of your code-- to anyone.
  * If you are looking for help you cannot show your code
  * If you are providing help to someone you cannot show your code.
3. Feel free to share online resources (other than those that are a direct cut-and-paste solution to his task).
4. Feel free to answer questions that are not code based. For ex., *I think you created a new workspace and forgot to install flask -> sudo easy_install flask*
5. Any question/answer exchanges that are entirely in English are fine (i.e., not sharing code snippets).


### Deliverables for First Sprint
1. Login working -- only people who are logged in can chat.
2. Messages stored in database. 
3. When a user logs in they will see some list of previous messages. 
4. Search. I can search for a particular term and see the results.
 
### You must host your code on github
